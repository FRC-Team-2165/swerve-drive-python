# swerve-drive-python
A basic swerve drive system for FRC

In order to use this for your own robot, you can either copy the components directory, 
which our team tends to use as a catch all for derived hardware. However, if that doesn't 
work with your team's setup, you can purely copy the contents of of `components/swerve` for your own
purposes. All of the business logic happens in there. The subsystem included here is not much 
more than a wrapper around the code so that it's `Command` friendly.
